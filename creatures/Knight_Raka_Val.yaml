description: "A former knight of Cleryonne. 
  She was a general during Ascanthian wars and is now the lady of Karalsund.
  She has tanned skin and brown hair. 
  Her demeanor is aprubt and she has a bit of a hubris. 
  Her bond is the loyalty to the few remaining people of Karalsund and the duty that comes with her title.
  \n\n
  Born in the steppes near Cleryonne she wasn't of noble descent.
  Through her military career she gained a title and received a small estate near the Eastern mountains.
  The land here is largely abandoned and the left over outposts are often ravaged by raiders or roaming elementals.
  She has formed a small militia trying to restore order in and around Karalsund."
