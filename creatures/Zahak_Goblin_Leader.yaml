description: "Zahak is a large, hairy goblinoid (Ilan'Shar/Bugbear).
  He has long braided hair and brown skin.
  He looks as if he had a rough time lately.
  His skin bears scars and he has a hungry look in his eyes.
  His demeanor is quiet and dismissive.
  He is an opportunist looking our for himself and his interests.
  Despite his sorry state he is a force to be reckoned with.
  He is dominating toward his allies and prone to violence.
  \n\n
  Zahak and his subjects escaped the goblin mines in the eastern Lyndwurm valley.
  Since then they have only encountered more peril.
  They got into a thunderstorm, were set upon by a wight and encountered a roaming earth elemental.
  They want to settle into a ruin to the north, but the area is still occupied by the earth elemental.
  Now they are at odds with the Black Hands after raiding a nearby farmstead.
  Raka Val wants them dead or at least driven out of the local area.
  \n\n
  On his body Zahak carries the following things of note with him:\n
  • A heavy iron key, stolen from the overseer of the goblin mines (unlocks the great iron door)\n
  • A heavy Ilan'Shari morningstar worth 30 gp\n
  • A squiggly note detailing an order of 200 ballista bolts for 'the pesky Elf'\n"
