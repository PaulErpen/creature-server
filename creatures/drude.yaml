- name: Unsettling screech
  desc: "The drude let's out a blaring screech. 
    Every humanoid and giant within 30 ft. of the drude that can hear the screech must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 3 rounds (15 seconds).
    A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. 
    If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
    A target that successfully saves is immune to any drude's screech for the next 24 hours."
