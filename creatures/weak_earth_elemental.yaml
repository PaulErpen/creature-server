description: "The untamed land can be dangerous. 
  Next to many kinds of beast there are also the elements fighting back against civilization.
  The elements are being tamed or surpressed in inhabited regions.
  As one approaches the edges of civilization, these forces gain in strength.
  Elementals are an expression of these forces.
  Some are peaceful, but mostly they are agents of entropy, seeking to disrupt any unnatural order."
